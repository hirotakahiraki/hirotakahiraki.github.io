Pose estimation is the estimation of the position of a certain human posture, i.e., the position of multiple joints such as shoulders, hips, hands, and feet, in two or three dimensional coordinates.
Pose estimation allows human "motion" to be communicated to a computer for use in motion analysis or as an input interface.
However, conventional pose estimation technology, which requires the use of an external camera to capture images of the target person and the use of multiple acceleration sensors on the entire body, is difficult to use on a daily basis, whether indoors or outdoors.
The e-Pose is a headphone-type posture estimation device.
