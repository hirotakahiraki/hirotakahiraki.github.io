I am a researcher, software engineer, ball juggler, and doctoral student at the University of Tokyoâ€™s Rekimoto Laboratory. My research focuses on Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), specifically on augmenting human capabilities through wearable devices. My primary interest lies in vocal communication, where I aim to innovate new forms of interaction by broadening the scope of everyday computer-handled devices.
